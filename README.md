This project is an experiment with Arduino, Python, PHP and a PC or MAC.

The goal is to show a graphic object signaling that the light is on in an environment usandoum sensor LDR.

The sensor LDR sends via arduino the amount of light captured, the arduino interprets the value is in the level of acceptation minimum brightness for the desktop.

A Python application reads the value sent to the serial port and sends the information to the web server of the ambient light.
